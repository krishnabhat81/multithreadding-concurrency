Futures and Callables
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Executor Framework presented in the com.concurrency.threadpool package
works with Runnable object, which can not return a result to caller....

If we need a thread to return a computed result we can use java.util.concurrent.Callable
(Callable object allows to return values after completion)

The Future (java.util.concurrent.Future) object is used to check the status of
Callable and retrieve the result from the Callable.
When we submit Callable object to Executor, the Framework will return an object
of type Future.

(Callable object uses generics to define the type of object which is returned)
